	* Use the data which is done by tf-idf to features suitable for modeling.
3. Cross Validation & Hyperparameter Tuning
	* K-fold :  Split the data into k equal sized subsamples. Retain one of subsample for testing model and repeat k times.
	* Hyperparameter Tuning : Learning rate, iterators, layers etc.
