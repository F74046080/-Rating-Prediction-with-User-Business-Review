# Rating Prediction with User Business Review

## Overview
Use following methods to accomplish the prediction of the restuarant rating
1. Text Data Processing
	* cunt vectorizer : Convert the words into matrix.
	* tf-idf(Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency) : Ignore some function words, catch some important words.
2. Feature Extraction and Engineering
	* Use the data which is done by tf-idf to features suitable for modeling.
3. Cross Validation & Hyperparameter Tuning
	* K-fold :  Split the data into k equal sized subsamples. Retain one of subsample for testing model and repeat k times.
	* Hyperparameter Tuning : Learning rate, iterators, layers etc.
4. Commercial Recommendation System

## Data
* training data
	* total nearly 8000
	* include review_id, business_id, user_id, text, date, stars
* test data
	* total nearly 2000
	* include review_id, business_id, user_id, text, date

## Purpose
Use training data to train model, then use the model for test data to predict the restaurant stars
